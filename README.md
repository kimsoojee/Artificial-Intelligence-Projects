# Artifical Intelligence Projects
``` 
1.Logistic Regression, 2.Computer Vision, 3.Atropos Game 
```
## Project Descriptions

### 1. Logistic Regression
```
The project goal is to understand how neural networks work and how to implement a simple neural network and train it using datasets.
Steps:
* Load a dataset.
* Implement a logistic regression classfier and train it.
* Plot decision boundary.
* Evaluate a classifier by computing accuracy and confusion matrix
```

### 2. Computer Vision
```
The goal of this project is to implement algorithms that recognize hand shapes or gestures on a video stream.
Steps:
* Apply image thresholding that turns pixels to grayscale so that the skin color turns to white. 
* Implement contours libraries to detect a hand and its shape. 
* Calculate angles between defects and count the number of fingers. 
```

### 3. Atropos Game
```
Atropos is a two-player game played on a triangle-shaped board.
The goal of this project is to implement a strategy to play this game intelligently. 
Steps:
* Implement Minimax method with Alpha-Beta Pruning to search the best movement.
* Apply evaluator that scorses on a movement
